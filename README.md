# PPA Case Study – On‑Site Solar Integration (50 kW)

Slides: presentation/case-study-ppa.pptxLength: 17 slidesAuthor: Maria Lyasota updated: July 2025

# Executive Summary

This case study evaluates two Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) structures—fixed‑price and mixed‑price—for a 5.5‑year term that includes a 50 kW on‑site solar installation at four retail locations (ACT, QLD, NSW, VIC). The analysis balances lowest delivered cost with the client’s ambition to reach 50 % or 100 % renewable energy by 2030 via Large‑scale Generation Certificates (LGCs).

Decision lever                Why it matters

PPA pricing model          Fixed price offers budget certainty but bakes in installation/maintenance margins; 
                           mixed price lowers headline cost yet exposes ~30 % of demand to market volatility.

On‑site solar share        50 kW arrays offset 40–60 % of peak demand (higher in ACT/QLD)
                           and 16–40 % of average consumption.

LGC strategy               LGC spot price ≈ A$40 (2025). Using LGCs to top‑up to 100 % RE is cheaper than oversizing rooftop solar
                           and remains viable until certificates sunset in 2030.

State feasibility          Rooftop rules and irradiation differ; ACT & QLD are highly suitable, NSW reasonable,
                           VIC moderate due to 160 MWh minimum and rooftop constraints.
                           
# Key Insights (Slide 6 & 8–14)

1. Cost vs. Renewables Trade‑off
   Mixed‑price PPA + LGC top‑up delivers lowest net $/MWh while still enabling a 100 % RE claim.

2. State‑level Feasibility

     - ACT and QLD: > 60 % peak load coverage; favorable regulations.

     - NSW: ~50 % coverage; no rooftop cap.

     - VIC: < 40 % coverage; rooftop & min‑capacity hurdles.

3. Seasonality Matters
  Summer generation (Oct–Mar) is up to 30 % higher than winter; sizing for summer peak prevents excessive winter grid draw.

4. Timeline Advantage
  Starting procurement Q3 2025 allows installation by Q1 2026, maximizing LGC issuance before 2030 sunset.

# Recommended Strategy

Goal                         Preferred Path                           Rationale

Cost leadership      50 % RE through mixed‑price PPA;            Lowest $/MWh; avoids LGC premiums.
                     buy spot power for the remainder.

Net‑zero alignment   100 % RE via mixed‑price PPA                Full renewable claim with minimal capex; 
                     certificates valid until 2030.              plus annual LGC surrender.


Install Window: Target rooftop installs Oct 2025 – Mar 2026 for highest first‑year yield.
